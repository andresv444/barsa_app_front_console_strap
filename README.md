### Bootstrap 4 support

Now UI Kit React is built on top of Bootstrap 4 using React, React Hooks, create-react-app and Reactstrap. This makes starting a new project very simple. It also provides benefits if you are already working on a Bootstrap 4, React or Reactstrap project; you can just import the Now UI Kit React style over it. Most of the elements have been redesigned; but if you are using an element we have not touched, it will fall back to the Bootstrap default.
